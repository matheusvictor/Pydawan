When contributing to this repository, first discuss the change you want to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Note that we have a code of conduct; follow it in all your interactions with the project.

Pull Request Process:
Check the existing issues in the repository;

Fork this repository. When you fork it, it's like a copy of the source code is created in your account, which you can modify without affecting the original repository;

Clone the copy of the repository to your local environment. Open the folder containing the file you want to resolve. Example: The first question in list01 will be in the following path: Pydawan / list01 / l1q01.py. Do not delete comment lines with the question, as other people may want to know what you have resolved. Comments are also important, so try commenting your code whenever possible so others can learn from it;

Once the issue is resolved, compile to test it before requesting a pull-request. Once that is done, sync your repository with the original and then commit to your repository;

Next, request a PR for the repository https://github.com/matheusvictor/Pydawan/ with the title resolves #numeroDaIssue. Example: solve # 1;

Question: Issues need to be resolved using features compatible with Python version 3.7.4 or lower.
Adding new questions to solve:
If you want to add new questions for others to solve, follow these steps:

In your local repository, choose one of the list folders and create the file for the question;

The level of the question should be according to the level, preferably. So simpler questions should be on list01 and so on. The complexity of the issue can be taken into account from factors such as number of variables used, amount of processing to be done until reaching the final result, etc.

If you consider complexity beyond current directories, create a special directory to address this issue. That is, if the question goes beyond list04, consider creating a folder list05, which will house the suggested question, numbered consecutively with the last one. That is, if the last question is something like l5q10.py, you should create l5q11.py.
Name the file following the pattern adopted in existing question files. Example: 11q99.py;

That done, open a PR with the commit creates l1q99.py question.

Fixing resolved issues:
If you notice an error in any of the questions, or believe that you can improve the existing statement and / or solution (if any), follow these steps:

Correct the wording and / or resolution of the question and open a PR with commit correct question l1q05.py, for example;

Or, if you prefer, open an issue titled Fix Issue lNqXX.py to identify which issue to fix. For example: Fix l1q05.py question. In the issue description, describe the problem as much as possible.

Translations:
You can also contribute to this repository by translating the questions into other languages, preferably your native language or some other language that you are fluent. If there is no list of exercises with the language you are looking for, create following the same pattern as the existing one or open an issue!

This topic is still under development!

Opening new issues:
If you noticed something wrong with any of the solutions, utterance or translation, you can report it from a new issue. But before you do so, carefully check that someone else has not reported this issue before, so you can avoid duplicate issues.

This topic will still be developed!
