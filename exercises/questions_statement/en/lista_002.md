- L2Q1. Read 3 values (assume that no equal values will be given) and write the largest of them.

- L2Q2. Read 3 values (assume that no equal values will be given) and write the sum of the 2 largest.

- L2Q3. Read the grades from the 1st and 2nd assessments of a student. Calculate the simple arithmetic mean and write a message that tells you whether or not the student has passed. Consider that a grade equal to or greater than 6 is approved. Also write the calculated average.

- L2Q4. Read the current year and year of birth of a person. Write a message that tells you whether or not she can vote this year (no need to consider the month the person was born). The person can vote if they are 16 or older.

- L2Q5. Read two values (assume that no equal values will be read) and write the largest of them.

- L2Q6. Read two values (assume that no equal values will be read) and write them in ascending order.

- L2Q7. Read two values and print one of the following three messages: 
    
    - 'equal numbers', if the numbers are equal;
    - 'First is greater' if the first is greater than the second; 'Second largest' if the second is greater than the first.

- L2Q8. Read 3 values (assume that no equal values will be given) and write them in ascending order.

- L2Q9. Read 3 values (A, B and C) representing the measurements of the sides of a triangle and write whether or not they form a triangle. NOTE: To form a triangle, the value of each side must be less than the sum of the other 2 sides.

- L2Q10. Make an algorithm to read a number that is a user code. If this code is different from a code stored internally in the algorithm (equal to 1234) the message 'Invalid user!' Should be displayed. If the Code is correct, read another value which is the password. If this password is incorrect (one is 9999) the message 'incorrect password' should be displayed. If the password is correct, the message 'Access allowed' should be displayed.
