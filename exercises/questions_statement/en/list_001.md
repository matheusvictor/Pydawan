- L1Q1. Write a Python program that stores the value 10 in a variable A and the value 20 in a variable B. Then (using only assignments between variables) change their contents causing the value that is in A to B and vice versa. At the end, write the values ​​that were stored in the variables.

- L1Q2. Make a Python program that reads a student's three grades, calculates and writes the student's final grade. Consider that the average is weighted and the weight of the grades is 2, 3 and 5. Formula for the final average calculation is: `final_grade = ((n1 * 2) + (n2 * 3) + (n3 * 5)) / 10`

- L1Q3. Build an algorithm that calculates a teacher's net salary. To make this algorithm, you must have some data, such as: gross salary amount and tax percentage. To calculate the amount of net salary, discount from gross salary the percentage of taxes.

- L1Q4. Develop an algorithm that can read a temperature in degrees Celsius and display it converted to degrees Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is `F ← (9 * C + 160) / 5`, where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celsius.

- L1Q5. Develop an algorithm that can read a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and display it converted to degrees Celsius. The conversion formula is `C ← ((F - 32) * 5) / 9`, where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celsius.

- L1Q6. Develop an algorithm capable of calculating and presenting the volume value of an oil can, the size of which should be defined by the user. Use the formula: `Volume ← π * Radius ^ 2 * Height`

- L1Q7. Develop an algorithm that reads three values ​​(A, B and C) and presents as a final result the sum of squares of the three values ​​read.

- L1Q8. Develop an algorithm that reads three values ​​(A, B and C) and presents as the final result the square of the sum of the three values ​​read.

- L1Q9. Design a program that calculates and presents the volume of a rectangular box. Use the formula: `VOLUME ← LENGTH * WIDTH * HEIGHT`.

- L1Q10. Read two values ​​(integers, reals or characters) for variables A and B, and exchange values ​​so that variable A has the value of variable B and variable B has the value of variable A. Display the changed values.
